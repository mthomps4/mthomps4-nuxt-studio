# Vim: When your team uses VS Code

When I first started to code I was always reminded it is not about the tools, but how you use them. "Don't spend so much time fretting and configuring an IDE..." someone suggested, "...just pick one so you can focus on learning what matters". This still holds true. So many of us still spend weeks on end finding the right IDE and configuration. For starters do I go with VS Code, Atom, Sublime, Vim, Emacs... the list goes on. Not to mention everyone one of these can be configured in their own right to the extreme with themes and extensions. 

***Then Enter Microsoft...*** 

Today if you enter the JavaScript/Typescript community, you are almost laughed at for not using VS Code. Microsoft is pumping all its resources into the JavaScript community obtaining GitHub, NPM, committing to React-Native, Maintaining Typescript, and building its own tools and extensions with these resources leaving us with an awesome tool VS Code. 

While I'm not discrediting VS Code and the community behind it, I'm often left with a weird feeling when I'm forced into something. I like VS Code, I use it daily, but I shouldn't NEED it, ya know. With my last client, the onboarding included me dropping my settings in VS Code and importing the "recommended" list of extensions, configs, etc. This goes beyond the scope of Eslint and Prettier configs. This was more to make every machine and developer use the same exact setup for code pairing... 

I don't like the flow of this... tabling for a better mental writing day...
