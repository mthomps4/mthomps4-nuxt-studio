  summary:
    - text: "I'm a builder and creator at heart."
    - text: "For over a decade, I've been immersed in software consulting, working across industries including IP Advertising, Healthcare, Telecom, and E-Commerce. I've helped companies understand and solve complex problems while leading teams to drive progress. My focus is on identifying the right problems and fostering team growth. Recognizing that no one should navigate this field alone, I share my experiences and lessons learned to build momentum and mentor others."
    - text: "Beyond software, my passion extends into the physical realm of fine woodworking, metalworking, and tool restoration. This pursuit is more than a hobby; it's a commitment to preserving and honing a craft passed down through generations prior. Similar to my approach with software development, I aim to mentor others in resourcefulness and honing their own craft (whatever that may be). By curating books, articles, and resources, I share the lessons gathered along the way and stay inspired to pass on a legacy of learning to those interested."
    - text: "Who knows? Maybe one day, I'll bridge the gap between traditional craftsmanship and modern technology. (AI and Robotics, anyone?) \n While my blog focuses primarily on Software Development, follow along for all the twists and turns I take honing one's craft."
