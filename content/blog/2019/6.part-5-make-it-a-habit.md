## Make it a Habit

You finished a project — congrats!

What’s next?

Do it all again!Only this time, you carry every experience from this project with you.

I know I need to plan better…
— *Is there a whiteboard around here?*

I know I may need to find better tools and resources…
— *I’ll Make the list.*

I know mistakes are going to happen…
— *But I can react differently this time
— I can continue to grow and learn.*

I know I can’t always do it all…
*— I’ll learn my limits
— I’ll ask for help*

I know if I keep building on my mistakes…
— *I’ll continue to grow.
— I’ll be able to help others grow*

Regardless of your profession.Woodworking, Development, or other, as we continue to push forward to make mistakes and learn, I hope we can do so together.

Do Good. Then do good work.

Until next time,Cheers!
