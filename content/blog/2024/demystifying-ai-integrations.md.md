## Intro

ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Bedrock, Gemini, and more.
In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, integrating AI capabilities might seem like a daunting task. But fear not! It's more accessible than you might think.

Let's break down the process and explore how you can add AI power to your web applications.

## The Building Blocks

At its core, AI integration in web apps consists of a few key components:

- The LLM (Large Language Model) to interface with. (Claude-sonnet, GPT-4o, etc)
- An API/SDK to communicate with the LLM. (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc)
- A UI layer to allow users to interact with our API.
- Prompt Engineer -- YOU the person asking your deepest darkest poster syndrome induced questions.

From here the rest is simply data/state management in the UI. e.g. How do we take the response from the LLM and display it to the user.

## Hello World

In this example we will use Anthropic's API for Claude to answer a simple question and display the response to the user.

This can be done in a variety of ways, the most common being a web app.
However, if you are an engineer spending your day in the terminal -- you may find a quick terminal application works just as well.

## Getting Started: A Bare-Bones Approach

Let's start with a simple example using the Anthropic AI SDK:

```ts
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
});

async function getChatResponse(prompt: string) {
  const response = await anthropic.completions.create({
    model: "claude-2",
    prompt: prompt,
    max_tokens_to_sample: 300,
  });

  return response.completion;
}
```

This snippet sets up the client and creates a basic function to interact with the AI. Simple, right?

## Integrating with Your UI

Once you have the backend set up, integrating with your UI is straightforward. Here's a React component example:

```ts
function AIChatComponent() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState("");
  const [response, setResponse] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const aiResponse = await getChatResponse(input);
    setResponse(aiResponse);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button type="submit">Ask AI</button>
      </form>
      <div>{response}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Beyond the Basics

As you get more comfortable, you can explore advanced features:

- Streaming Responses: For a more dynamic user experience.
- Error Handling: Gracefully manage API failures or rate limiting.
- Context Management: Maintain conversation history for more coherent interactions.

## It's Not Just for Big Tech

Remember, AI integration isn't limited to tech giants. Small projects and individual developers can leverage these tools too. Whether you're building a personal blog, a productivity app, or a business tool, there's likely an AI use case that can enhance your project.

## The Flexibility of AI

While we've used Anthropic's Claude as an example, the principles apply to various AI services. Whether you're using OpenAI, Hugging Face, or even your own custom model, the integration process follows a similar pattern.

## Server-Side Considerations

For production applications, consider server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO. Frameworks like Next.js, combined with Vercel's AI SDK, make this process smoother:

```ts
import { OpenAIStream, StreamingTextResponse } from 'ai'

export const runtime = 'edge'

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // AI logic here
  const stream = await OpenAIStream(response)
  return new StreamingTextResponse(stream)
}
```

## Wrapping Up

Integrating AI into your web applications doesn't have to be intimidating. Start small, experiment, and gradually expand your AI features. With the right approach, you'll be surprised at how quickly you can add powerful AI capabilities to your projects.
Remember, the key is to start simple and build from there. Happy coding!
