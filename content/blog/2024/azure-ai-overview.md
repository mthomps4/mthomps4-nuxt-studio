# Intro

This week I dove into Microsoft’s free learning path for Azure AI Fundamentals where I began learning all the terms and hype relating to AI and Machine Learning. This was a solid introduction to the various types of machine learning processes and how these pieces start to fit together into larger applications. I was also introduced to Azure’s Machine Learning Studio. Here, I was able to start creating my own ML Job and API endpoints to see tools and features that are readily available for our Engineering team to tap into. While this was my first real go at anything ML, and barely scratches the surface. I’m excited to see what else these courses have to offer.

Stay tuned for more posts as I continue through the course!

I'll be starting to dive into Machine Learning with Elixir as well, building out simple models and experimenting with different techniques.
